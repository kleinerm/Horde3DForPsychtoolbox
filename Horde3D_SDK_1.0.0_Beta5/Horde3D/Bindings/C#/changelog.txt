Bugfixes:
- As a result of multithreading instability all samples are now single-threaded, using the application event handler Idle.
- Identified and removed the FPS-Bug. After resetting the stopwatch the time interval measurement has to be startet again.
- Workaround implemented into sample source, because Horde3D crashes in case resize() is called before init().

Remarks:
If you would like to disable the mouse tracking don't forget to call Invalidate() to redraw the scene
