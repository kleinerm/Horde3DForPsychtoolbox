About Horde3D .NET wrapper
==========================
The Horde3D .NET wrapper is a light-weight open source library, implemented in C# 2.0 for Horde3D, a small open source 3D rendering engine.
The intention is to open the simple and intuitive interface of the next-generation engine Horde3D to the .NET community.

See the Horde3D SDK documentation (http://www.nextgen-engine.net/docs/manual.html) for descriptions of all the Horde3D .NET Wrapper functions. 
You should have a look at the included samples Chicago .NET and Knight.NET for some examples of how to use Horde3D .NET in your own programs.
