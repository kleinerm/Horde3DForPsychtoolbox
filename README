Horde3DForPsychtoolbox - An interface to the Horde3D engine for Psychtoolbox-3:

Horde3DForPsychtoolbox is a thin interface between Psychtoolbox-3 and the Horde3D
open-source 3D graphics rendering engine <http://www.horde3d.org/>.

It consists of a set of compiled mex files for GNU/Octave and Matlab, one for
each supported operating system platform and machine architecture which wrap
essential Horde3D engine functions in the same style as other Psychtoolbox
mex files. The Horde3DHelper.m M-File provides higher level convenience functions
and an interface to Psychtoolbox imaging pipeline, so Horde3D rendering can take
full advantage of the post-processing and display functionality of Psychtoolbox
image processing and display pipeline.

A few demo M-File demonstrate basic use of Horde3D + Psychtoolbox for 3D
rendering of complex scenes.

The Contents/ subfolder contains demo shaders, textures, objects, scenery etc.
for use by the demos.

The distro also contains a copy of the full Horde3D SDK in the version used
for building the mex files and precompiled versions of the Horde runtime
libraries for all supported operating systems. The latest source distribution
of Horde SDK can be found at their website.

OSX + GNU/Octave:
-----------------

You will need to copy the octave runtime libraries liboctinterp.6.dylib and
liboctave.6.dylib from your systems octave installation to the HordeOSX64/
subfolder of this folder. A valid copy of these files can also be found
in the Psychtoolbox/PsychBasic/OctaveOSX64/ folder of your Psychtoolbox
installation.
